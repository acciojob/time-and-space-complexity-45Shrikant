	<h1>Time Space Complexity</h1>

<p>
Time complexity describes how the execution time of an algorithm grows with input size. An algorithm with lower Time complexity is considered more efficient and performs better for large inputs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. An algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size.
